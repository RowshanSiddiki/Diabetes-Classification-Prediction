# Diabetes-Classification-Prediction
This dataset is used to predict the onset of diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. It was originally collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

Attributes:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).

Age: Age in years.
Target Variable:

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1). 0 represents no diabetes, 1 represents diabetes.
This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on these diagnostic measurements.
